# Music-Controlled-LEDs
Recruitment project for 1st yearites

Have you ever been intrigued by the flickering lights in a disco or a concert?
Well, here's your chance to convert your room into one.

We present to you our project-"MUSIC CONTROLLED LEDs".
## Team Members:

1. Somil Dhiman
2. Akriti Jain
3. Dev Srivastava
4. Ravi Prakash
5. Ayan Shree

## Mentors:

1. Anjali Rana
2. Avichal Gupta

## Objective:

We planned to make a 3-Dimensional 4x4x4 Music ControlledLED
Cube. Our objective was to programme the circuit forvarious
intensity values. The circuit would detect these values from a
sound/music source through a sensor and light dierentLEDs
governing cool patterns.


## Components Required:

● Arduino MEGA 

● Connecting wires

 ● LEDs (Light-emitting diode)

 ● Sound Sensor 

 ● Resistor 


## Road Map:

 ● Collection of data sets:

 ● Circuit Simulation:

 ● Working on the Code:
