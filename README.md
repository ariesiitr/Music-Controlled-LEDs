# Music-Controlled-LEDs
Recruitment project for 1st yearites

Have you ever been intrigued by the flickering lights in a disco or a concert?
Well, here's your chance to convert your room into one.

We present to you our project-"MUSIC CONTROLLED LEDs".
## Team Members:

## Objective:

We planned to make a 3-Dimensional 4x4x4 Music Controlled LED
Cube. Our objective was to programme the circuit for various
intensity values. The circuit would detect these values from a
sound/music source through a sensor and light different LEDs
governing cool patterns.


## Components Required:

● Arduino MEGA 

● Connecting wires

● LEDs (Light-emitting diode)

● Sound Sensor 

● Resistor 


## Road Map:

 ● Collection of data sets
 ```
   Due to the lack of physical sound sensors, we collected raw data using the Arduino Science Journal app. 
   This involved recording 25 different songs and measuring their pitch and intensity. 
   Then, we analysed this data to prepare our intensity ranges.
   Given below is the link to our data sets-

 ● Circuit Simulation
  ```
    For designing and simulating the circuit, we used the Tinkercad Circuit Simulator.
  ```

 ● Working on the Code
 ```
    The code will be written in Arduino IDE and then uploaded to the mega board.
 ```

The video of our working model is also included in the repository.
